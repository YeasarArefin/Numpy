# Nympy.ipynb

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is structured in two main phases, covering the basics and more advanced array operations.

## Contents

### Phase 1: NumPy Basics
- **Importing NumPy**
- **Creating Arrays**: From lists, 1D and 2D arrays
- **List vs Numpy Array**: Element-wise operations
- **Creating Arrays from Scratch**: Using `zeros`, `ones`, `full`, `random`, and `arange`
- **Vector, Matrix, and Tensor**: Understanding different array dimensions
- **Array Properties**: Shape, dimension, size, and datatype
- **Array Reshaping**: Reshape, flatten, ravel, and transpose

### Phase 2: Array Operations
- **Selecting and Slicing**: 1D and 2D array slicing, negative indexing
- **Sorting**: Sorting 1D and 2D arrays
- **Filtering**: Boolean indexing and masks
- **Fancy Indexing and np.where**: Advanced selection and conditional replacement
- **Adding and Removing Data**: Concatenation, stacking, and deletion
- **Array Compatibility**: Checking shapes and combining arrays

## Usage
Each section contains both markdown explanations and Python code cells. The code demonstrates practical NumPy operations with printed outputs for clarity.
